## Implementation Metrics

<!--
  Structured retro signals — auto-appended during /implement.
  These quantified metrics enable data-driven retrospectives.
-->

### Task Metrics

<!--
  Appended at task completion. One entry per task.
  Format:

  #### T014 [US3] ProspectPipeline
  | Metric | Value |
  |--------|-------|
  | Turns | [count] |
  | Self-corrections | [count and brief description] |
  | Files created | [count] |
  | Files modified | [count] |
-->

_Populated during /implement._

### Gate Metrics

<!--
  Appended at gate completion. One entry per GATE_USn.
  Format:

  #### GATE_US3
  | Metric | Value |
  |--------|-------|
  | Engineering ACs | [pass/total] PASS/FAIL |
  | User Journey steps | [pass/total] PASS/FAIL |
  | Intelligence evals | Structural: [result], Semantic: [score] |
  | Validator model | [model used] |
  | Validator turns | [count] |
-->

_Populated during /implement._

### Feature Summary
